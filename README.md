# Digital-Clock

Hey folks, its me again!!

This time i attempted to create a digital clock and no doubt its not so bad for my first attempt..

C'mon let me give u all a quick review Lessgo 👇🏼

Features:

🟤 shows hours, minutes and seconds

🔴 shows AM / PM

🟡 also shows the current day and date (month & year)

I completed this project using HTML, CSS AND JavaScript. If u wanna know how I did, u can check it down here:

🔵 First, I created the basic structure of the digital clock with HTML and then frosted some CSS topping on it.

🟠 After that, JS made its entry as a super hero and saved my day:

•	Select all the HTML elements u require in this JS file.
•	Create a function updateClock()
•	Use the date object to get an exact time, day and date.
•	For setting AM/PM value, we'll make a condition while keeping in mind the fact that the Date object works on 24-hour format so we have to change it to 12-hour format.
•	Also we'll make a logic to add 0 with any single digit number.
•	Call setTimeOut() which sets a timer that executes stopwatch function once the timer (in ms) expires.
•	Run updateClock().
•	Its all done!!
I'm just like a nestling bird who is learning to survive in this new and gigantic Programming world. Ur precious advice of how I could I improve my coding will be highly appreciated :)
